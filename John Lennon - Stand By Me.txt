John Lennon - Stand By Me (CAPO na 2a.)

[Intro] G  Em  C  D  G

[Primeira Parte]

When the night has come
Em
   And the land is dark
         C          D           G
And the moon is the only light we'll see

[Pré-Refrão]

No, I won't be afraid
      Em
No, I    won't be afraid
         C            D           G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Refrão]

And, darling, darling stand by me, oh now now
Em
   Stand by me
C             D           G
  Stand by me,  stand by me

[Segunda Parte]

If the sky that we look upon
Em
   Should tumble and fall
         C                 D             G
And the mountains should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
      Em
No, I    won't shed a tear
         C            D           G
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Refrão]

And, darling, darling stand by me, oh
Em
   Stand by me
C             D             G
  Stand by me,  stand by me   stand by me

[Solo] Em  C  D  G
       Em  C  D  G

[Refrão Final]

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
             Em
Oh, now, now,   stand by me
           C       D            G
Oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

Darlin', darlin', stand by me
Em
   Stand by me
           C       D            G
Oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
