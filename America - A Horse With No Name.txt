America - A Horse With No Name

[Verso]

       Em                D/F#
On the first part of the journey
      Em                 D/F#
I was looking at all the life
           Em                   D/F#
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D/F#
There were sand and hills and rings

    Em                      D/F#
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
        Em          D/F#
and the sky with no clouds
    Em                   D/F#
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
        Em              D/F#
But the air was full of sound


[Refrão]

     Em                      D/F#
I've been thru the desert on a horse with no name
        Em                   D/F#
It felt good to be out of the rain
       Em                D/F#
In the desert you can't remember your name
            Em                 D/F#
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

      Em              D/F#
After two days in the desert sun
   Em              D/F#   
My skin began to turn red
      Em                D/F#
After three days in the desert fun
      Em                 D/F#
I was looking at a river bed

        Em                 D/F#
And the story it told of a river that flowed
        Em                  D6/9
Made me sad to think it was dead

[Refrão]

             Em                  D/F#
You see I've been thru the desert on a horse with no name
        Em                   D/F#
It felt good to be out of the rain
       Em               D/F#
In the desert you can't remember your name
            Em                D/F#
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

      Em                  D/F#
After nine days I let the horse run free
          Em         D/F#
Cause the desert had turned to sea
           Em                   D/F#
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D/F#
There were sand and hills and rings

    Em                         D/F#
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
        Em               D/F#
And the perfect disguise above
          Em            D/F#
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
        Em                  D/F#
But the humans will give no love

[Refrão]

     Em                       D/F#
I've been thru the desert on a horse with no name
        Em                   D/F#
It felt good to be out of the rain
       Em                D/F#
In the desert you can't remember your name
            Em                 D/F#
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
