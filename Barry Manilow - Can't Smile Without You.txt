Barry Manilow - Can't Smile Without You

D             G 
  You know I can't smile without you
Em 
  I can't smile without you
C 
  I can't laugh and I can't sing
D 
  I'm finding it hard to do anything
G 
You see I feel sad when you're sad
Em 
I feel glad when you're glad
C 
If you only knew what I'm going through
D                         G
I just can't smile without you

G              Em
You came along just like a song
C 
And brighten my day
D                                    G
  Who would've believed that you where part of a dream
Em              C
Now it all seems light years away

D                    G
(And now you know) I can't smile without you
Em 
I can't smile without you
C 
I can't laugh and I can't sing
D                           
I'm finding it hard to do anything
G 
You see I feel sad when your sad
Em 
I feel glad when you're glad
C 
If you only knew what I'm going through
D 
I just can't smile

C                                  G                          Em 
Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find
             C                                        D        
Well, I'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me

G 
And you see I can't smile without you
Em 
I can't smile without you
C 
I can't laugh and I can't sing
D                                
I'm finding it hard to do anything
       G 
You see I feel glad when you're glad
Em 
I feel sad when you're sad
C 
If you only knew what I'm going through
D                      G 
I just can't smile without you
