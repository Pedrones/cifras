Don't worry, be happy

D
  Ain't got no place to lay your head
     Em7
Somebody came and took your bed
       G         D
Don't worry, be happy
     D
The landlord say your rent is late
    Em7
He may have to litigate
 G               D
Don't worry, be happy

  Ain't got not cash, ain't got no style
 Em7
Ain't got no girl to make you smile
       G         D

        D
Cause when you worry your face will frown
Em7
And that will bring everybody down

Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy
