I can't remember nothing, no no no

But the good times we used to share, my love
D                         F#m7
I'm so sad and lonely

Without you, my life is so dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Em7            F#m7
I'm sorry to say

You go your way and I'll go my way
Em7                 F#m7
It hurts deep inside

The day we said goodbye, but
