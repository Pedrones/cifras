Lighthouse Family - High

G                    D              Em            C
When you´re close to tears remember someday it´ll all 
be over
G                D       Em    C
One day we gonna get so high.
G                  D               Em            
Though it´s darker than december what´s ahead is a 
  C
different colour
G                    D      Em   C
One day we´re gonna get so high.

[Pre-Chorus]

           Dm                          Cm
And at the end of the day remember the days when we 
were close to the end
Dm                 Cm
And wonder how we made it through the night.
        Dm                         Cm
At the end of the day remember the way we stayed so 
close to the end
Dm                    C      D
We´ll remember it was me and you

[Chorus]

      G            D      Em          C
Cause we are gonna be forever you and me,
        G               D                  Em      C
You'll always keep it flying high in the sky of love

[Verse]

G                     D               Em          
Don´t you think it´s time you started doing what we 
         C
always wanted
G                    D     Em    C
One day we´re gonna get so high
G                 D          Em                  
Cause even the impossible is easy when we got each 
   C
other
G                   D   Em    C
One day we´re gonna get so high

At the end of the day remember the way we stayed so

We´ll remember it was me and you
